-create code that checks for boot file that has been stamped and updates access point name and password accordingly

-normalize permissions of files

-update status tool, network manager, and help to include OTG MODE

-take photos for website

-WHY do we copy the dnsmasq.conf to .orig after changing it in the enable scripts...?

-distributed install: rpc-install <package> <nodes>

-FIX AND TEST rpc-shutdown && rpc-reboot (currently doesnt do anything i dont think)

-DEREK: locale fix

-Write 5 sentence pitch

-Draw up project plan and milestones

-STAMP TOOl

-remove reboot from config and instead check for config in PS and kill it if it exists

-add output for rpc-update/reboot/shutdown/install so we know how close to being done it is TRY THIS sudo apt-get install <package> | debconf-apt-progress


TESTING:
-why does the -eq bug come upt everytime
-why are old leases still active


NETWORK MANAGER:

-need to create enable and disable scripts for all 3 modes
1)wifi : DONE
2)switch : DONE
3)otg : NOT DONE

-for OTG:
1) dns to allow for a connection without a unique mac address on otg
2) make connection, then run ip_configuration-like program to give the currently connected non-configured pi a unique ip address and otg mac address
